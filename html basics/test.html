    <h1>Hey!! This was coded by "NotChan"! And today i'am gonna teach you the basics of HTML!!'</h1>
    <h2>So first, that thing upside this text it's called H1, There are a couple of H's, like h2, h3, h4, until 6!!, This is an h2</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph! I gotta tell you can also customize your H's and your paragraphs, even your HTML!!'</p>
    <h5>So let's customize an h1 with a red color!!'</h5>
    <h1 style="color:red">This is an h1 with a red color!</h1>
    <p>To do this, it's pretty simple, just type (tag)h1 style="color:red"(close tag)'</p>
    <p>You can also customize fonts!!</p>
    <h1 style="font-family:Impact">This is a h1 with "Impact" Font!!</h1>
    <h2>You can do a LOT of things with html, and there's HTML5, CSS, etc. They are more advanced and complex'</h2>
    <h2>Oh and also, you can add images!!</h2>
    <p>I don't have something special to test the image function, but i'll put something random from my gallery xD</p>
    <img src="C:\Users\DELL\OneDrive\Desktop\html basics\media\animegirl.png" alt="Oops! Looks like you need a folder to load this media!! You can find it on my GitHub!!.." />
    <p>To do the image command just type: (open tag)img src="location of the image in your computer" alt:"whatever"(close tag)</p>
    <p>So that's pretty much you must know about HTML basics!! If there's any complains you can just contact me at my discord: notChan#0001</p>
    See ya!
